## üîí Threat Event: Unauthorized Gambling Website Access & History Deletion

### **John Doe Accessing Gambling Sites Despite Prior Warnings & Deleting Browser History**

#### **Example Scenario**
John Doe (aka **labuserich**) has been **previously warned** about accessing gambling websites such as **FanDuel** and **DraftKings** during work hours. His manager suspects that he is still **visiting these sites** and **actively deleting his browser history** to cover his tracks. The security team has been tasked with **conducting an investigation** to confirm whether John is violating company policy.

---

### **üîç Reason for the Hunt**
- **John Doe has a history of visiting gambling websites** during work hours.
- **He is suspected of deleting his browsing history** to avoid detection.
- The security team must **verify and document** whether policy violations continue.

---

## **‚ö†Ô∏è Steps the "Bad Actor" Took to Create Logs and IoCs**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Access Gambling Websites on Work Computer**
- John visits gambling websites like **fanduel.com** and **draftkings.com** before the **Sunday NFL games**.
- He **places sports bets and enters parlays** while at work.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Deletes Browser History to Cover Tracks**
- After placing his bets, John **manually deletes his browsing history** from **Firefox**.
- Alternatively, he uses **private/incognito mode** to prevent history from being stored.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Attempts to Bypass Security Controls**
- John may use **VPN services or proxy websites** to hide his traffic.
- He may clear **DNS cache** using the following command in CMD to remove traces:
  ```cmd
  ipconfig /flushdns
  ```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Continued Policy Violations**
- Despite **prior warnings**, John continues this behavior, making it necessary for security to **investigate further**.

---

## **üîß High-Level Firefox Browser History Detection Discovery Plan**
- **Check `DeviceNetworkEvents`** for any signs of **outgoing connections** to FanDuel or DraftKings Sportsbook.
- **Check `DeviceProcessEvents`** for any signs of **incognito mode usage** or command-line **clearing of DNS cache**.
- **Check `DeviceFileEvents`** for any **browser history deletion** and other suspicious file modifications.

---

## **üîç Steps Taken During Investigation**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Initial Querying**
- Started with baseline queries for **DeviceNetworkEvents, DeviceProcessEvents, and DeviceFileEvents**.
- This provided a foundation to identify key activity related to **unauthorized gambling site access and deletion of evidence**.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Identified Gambling Website Access**
- Within the first **five minutes**, I discovered that **John had visited FanDuel and DraftKings** using the following query:
  ```kql
  DeviceNetworkEvents
  | where RemoteUrl has_any ("fanduel.com", "draftkings.com")
  ```
- Multiple **successful connections** confirmed access to restricted sites.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Investigated Private Browsing Mode Usage**
- Used `DeviceProcessEvents` to check for **incognito mode usage in Firefox**.
- While **no explicit evidence** of `-private` mode was found, **Firefox was launched at 4:38 PM**, aligning with the gambling site access.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** Even though private browsing mode was used, the logs still recorded a process creation event at the time of gambling site access.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Detected DNS Cache Flush ‚Äì Attempt to Hide Evidence**
- **Queried `DeviceProcessEvents`** for `ipconfig /flushdns` executions.
- **At 5:22 PM**, `ipconfig.exe /flushdns` was executed by John.
- **This suggests an intentional attempt** to remove traces of site visits from the DNS cache.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Investigated Browser History Deletion**
- **Queried `DeviceFileEvents`** for `places.sqlite` deletion (Firefox history database).
- **Initial query found no results**.
- Upon further investigation, **a `FileDeleted` event was discovered at 4:11 PM** under:
  ```plaintext
  C:\Users\labuserich\AppData\Local\Temp\7zSC1834886\core\firefox.exe
  ```
- This suggests a **possible attempt to delete temporary browsing data**, but does not directly confirm browsing history deletion.

---

## **üö® Final Assessment**
- **‚úÖ Confirmed Unauthorized Gambling Website Access** ‚Äì John actively accessed **FanDuel & DraftKings during work hours**.
- **‚úÖ Confirmed Attempt to Evade Detection** ‚Äì A **DNS cache flush** was executed, likely to remove traces of site visits.
- **‚ùì Possible History Deletion** ‚Äì No direct deletion of `places.sqlite`, but **Firefox-related file deletions** raise concerns.

---

## **üì¢ Conclusion**
The user **"labuserich" (John Doe)** has demonstrated a **clear pattern of policy violations**:
1. **Visiting restricted gambling websites** during work hours.
2. **Potentially using private browsing mode** to avoid detection.
3. **Clearing DNS logs** to remove evidence.
4. **Deleting Firefox-related files**, potentially linked to browser history cleanup.

üîç **While no direct deletion of browsing history was found, the combined actions strongly indicate an attempt to avoid detection.**

---

## **üîç Recommended Next Steps**
1. **Monitor DNS & Web Traffic** ‚Äì Implement **alerts** for visits to gambling sites.
2. **Check for Additional File Modifications** ‚Äì Investigate further file deletions in **Firefox profile directories**.
3. **Enforce Security Controls** ‚Äì Consider **blocking gambling websites at the network level**.
4. **Escalate to HR/Management** ‚Äì Given **prior warnings**, further disciplinary action may be required.
